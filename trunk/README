ABOUT
PixelStruct is an opensource tool for visualizing 3D scenes reconstructed from
photographs. It uses the opensource structure-from-motion system Bundler, which
is based on the same research as Microsoft Live Labs Photosynth.

HOW TO COMPILE
PixelStruct requires the following libraries:
 - Qt4
 - OpenGL
 
Once you have installed these, compile the program with:
  mkdir build/ && cd build/ && cmake .. && make && cd ..

This will create a binary called 'pixelstruct' in build/src/, which you can
either copy into your PATH, or run directly with:
  ./build/src/pixelstruct

USAGE
PixelStruct requires Bundler, which can be downloaded from
<http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/>. First, you need to manually run
Bundler on a directory of images as described at either
<http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/bundler-v0.2-manual.html> or the
README.txt file contained in the Bundler distribution.

Once Bundler has completed processing the images, the image set can be loaded
into PixelStruct. Launch PixelStruct as described above, and go to "File>Open
image directory". Navigate into the image directory you ran Bundler on, and hit
"Choose". The 3D point cloud will be loaded into the window, and once the viewer
has focus (you may have to click on it for this), the camera will focus on the
first image. You can now hit your Return key to move to the next image, or use
your arrow keys to move to another image in the chosen direction. Pressing Page
Up and Page Down will attempt to move the camera closer to and further away from
the photographed object.
